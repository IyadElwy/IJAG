# Installation & Setup
First you will need to install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download) as well as [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

But DO NOT start minikube yet.

After that run the `initial-setup.sh` script to setup minikube and get your first task.
